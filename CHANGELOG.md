# Changelog

## [1.2.0] - 2025-06-02

- **Breaking change:** The Email Log DB entity, repository interface, and associated setting have all been removed. The
  benefit of having these items in the package was negligible. Any desired email logging will need to be independently
  implemented by each client application. If your app relied on these items, you can find the originals here and copy
  them to your own codebase:

    - [EmailLog](https://github.com/gaepdit/email-service/blob/388fb6f29525a3930ba8a5e88ea83f192fdcc1ae/src/EmailService/EmailLogRepository/EmailLog.cs)
    - [IEmailLogRepository](https://github.com/gaepdit/email-service/blob/388fb6f29525a3930ba8a5e88ea83f192fdcc1ae/src/EmailService/EmailLogRepository/IEmailLogRepository.cs)
